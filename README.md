## Any issues you encountered
*Some Issues that I encounturend in the process was that the installation took way to long.
* Another issue was that I had trouble deploying the Honeypot. Thankfully Sara had the same problem and found an answer online. I ran the command she found and tested and then it deployed.
*Another issue I got was that I got an error that would not let me fun gcloud comands. I was able to get around this by installing gcloud on my linux and reauthenticatng my account by running gcloud auth login.
